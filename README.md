This repository contains a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. With each guess, the game provides feedback to help the player narrow down their options. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the target number or reach the maximum number of attempts allowed.
